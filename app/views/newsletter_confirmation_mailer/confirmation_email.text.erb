Hello,

We really appreciate your interest in Schemabook. We're building a stakeholder focused tool to help organizations mature their data practices. Some people may think of us as a central schema registry. Others may be excited about our involvement in data contracts. Whatever your interest, we hope to provide something meaningful for your data team. We'd love to hear from you if there is functionality you are looking for us to provide.

Thanks,
The Schemabook team

** Just fyi, thanks for your support. We really appreciate it!
