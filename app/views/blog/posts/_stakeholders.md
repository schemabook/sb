### We're focused on stakeholders

When it comes to data within an organization, there are typically two main 
groups of stakeholders: the producers and the consumers. In many organizations, 
there is a disconnect between these two groups, with data often being thrown 
over the fence from one to the other without any collaboration.

In a previous organization, this lack of collaboration was evident in the 
search term analytics department. The website had a typical search form. 
Customers would search for products they were interested in. The analytics 
department was responsible for distilling this data down into a consumable 
report for the executive team. The report included break down by geographic 
region. The idea was to identify what was trending in each major region. 

In a typical ETL setup, this report was stale by a day at best. Essentially, 
the team that implemented the search functionality would export data for a 
24 hour period every night at midnight. This didn't allow the flexibility to 
respond the executives were looking for. If a sudden spike occurred for a 
product in a specific region, the team wanted to respond within the hour, not 
the next day. So, the team responsible for the report needed to ingest the data 
on a faster cadence, perhaps in real time. However, the team didn't know who 
implemented search. All they knew was that data was landing in a table in the 
lake every 24 hours. They didn't know the producers. They didn't know how to 
request the data on a faster cadence.

This common scenario highlights the need for a platform like Schemabook, which 
allows data producers to declare their data and set expectations for delivery, 
such as frequency and storage. Consumers can then easily search for and 
discover the data they need, defining themselves as stakeholders and staying 
informed of any changes. Schemabook facilitates collaboration between producers 
and consumers, ensuring that data is actionable and costs are minimized.

By focusing on stakeholders rather than specific technologies, Schemabook aims 
to improve data collaboration within organizations, ultimately leading to more 
effective and efficient data usage.
