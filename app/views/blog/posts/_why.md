### Why we are building Schemabook


Schemabook's ultimate goal is to make data more actionable through improving 
collaboration and improving quality. While building a central component of the 
data platform at a Fortune 100 company, Schemabook's founder experienced first 
hand how much effort and cost went into collecting data that the business 
could not immediately act on or just could not use.

The data was collected and possibly even transformed but either just sat in a 
lake occupying space and incurring costs or required additional institutional 
knowledge to be useful. The issue was not related to the technologies used, 
nor the architecture. It was a people and process problem. Not all of the 
stakeholders were on the same page. Many times they didn't know each other or 
weren't even aware of each other. 

How can data producers confidently deliver data that consumers need to perform 
their responsibilities? How can consumers make requests of the producers when 
they can't identify them? The outcome everyone is looking for is grounded in 
stakeholders collaborating. Schemabook is a data stakeholder collaboration 
product.

Schemabook revolves around the idea of declared schemas but it's not just a 
central schema registry. It helps stakeholders stay on the same page. It 
provides a space for data contracts to be defined and shared. It provides 
tooling for engineering teams to ensure the quality of the data they produce 
and consume. Stakeholders can identify themselves easily without a burdensome 
process. Changes to data can be discussed and prepared ahead of time 
preventing down time and data loss.

If your stakeholders don't know one another or aren't collaborating on 
defining the data needed to accelerate your business, please give Schemabook 
a try. Don't just land data in a lake or warehouse without knowing what it is 
used for. We think our lightweight approach can help you turn the page on the 
story of data in your organization.
