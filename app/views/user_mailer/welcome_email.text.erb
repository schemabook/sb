Hello,

We really appreciate your interest in Schemabook. We're building a stakeholder focused tool to help organizations mature their data practices. Some people may think of us as a central schema registry. Others may be excited about our involvement in data contracts. Whatever your interest, we hope to provide something meaningful for your data team. We'd love to hear from you if there is functionality you are looking for us to provide.

Your account is currently on our free plan. While on this plan, there are only a few limitations in place. You can create 10 schemas and services. You can invite as many stakeholders as you would like. In order to create more than 10 schemas and services, we require payment. Payment details can be found in your account settings.

To login, just follow this link: http://www.schemabook.com/users/sign_in.

If you have questions, contact us at support@schemabook.com.

Thanks,
The Schemabook team

** Just fyi, your account was created on: <%= Date.today %>. Enjoy!
