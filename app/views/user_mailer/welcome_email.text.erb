Hello,

We really appreciate your interest in Schemabook. We're building a stakeholder focused tool to help organizations mature their data practices. Some people may think of us as a central schema registry. Others may be excited about our involvement in data contracts. Whatever your interest, we hope to provide something meaningful for your data team. We'd love to hear from you if there is functionality you are looking for us to provide.

Our trial period is 14 days long. During this time, there are no limitations in place. You can create as many schemas and invite as many stakeholders as you would like. When the trial ends we'll ask for payment. Your data won't be deleted, you just won't be able to add any more after the trial until payment is in place.

To login, just follow this link: http://www.schemabook.com/users/sign_in.

If you have questions, contact us at support@schemabook.com.

Thanks,
The Schemabook team
