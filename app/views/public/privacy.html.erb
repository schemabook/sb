              <p>For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.

If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at hello@schemabook.com. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data.

              <ul>
                <li>Contractual Necessity:&nbsp; We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services.

                    <li>Profile or Contact Data</li>

We may also de-identify or anonymize Personal Data to further our legitimate interests. Examples of these legitimate interests include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Providing, customizing and improving the Services.</li>
