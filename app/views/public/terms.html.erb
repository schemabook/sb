            way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document as 
            well as those in the <a href="<%= privacy_path%>">Privacy Policy</a> and any other relevant policies.<strong> Your use of or participation in certain Services 
            may also be subject to additional policies, rules and/or conditions (</strong>“<strong>Additional Terms”), which are incorporated herein by reference, and you understand 
            and agree that by using or participating in any such Services, you agree to also comply with these Additional Terms.</strong></p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Please read these Terms carefully. </strong>They cover important information about Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. 
            <strong>These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, a class action waiver and resolution of disputes 
            by arbitration instead of in court. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, 
            YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="will-these-terms-ever-change">Will these Terms ever change?</h2><p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with 
            our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at <a href="https://schemabook.com">https://schemabook.com</a>, 
            send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in 
            any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>

            <p>To use the Services, you may be required to sign up for an account. You must provide accurate and complete information for your account and keep all such account 
            information updated. To the extent the Services enable you to create additional user accounts in connection with your account, you may do so for your employees, contractors 
            and agents. You shall not permit more than the authorized number of authorized users to use your account in any manner, and shall not, nor shall you permit any of your 
            authorized users, to share any access credentials for the Services with any other individuals or entities. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your 
            account, including on authorized user accounts, whether or not authorized, and for keeping all access credentials associated with your account, including authorized user 
            accounts, secure. You agree to promptly notify Schemabook of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Additionally, you may be able to access certain parts or features of the Services by using your account credentials from other services (each, a “Third Party Account”), 
            such as those offered by Google and/or GitHub. By using the Services through a Third Party Account, you permit us to access certain information from such account for use 
            by the Services. You are ultimately in control of how much information is accessible to us and may exercise such control by adjusting your privacy settings on your Third 
            Party Account.</p>

            of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, 
            then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Subject to these Terms, we grant each user of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use (i.e., to download and display

            <br/>
            <p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission”. Some User Submissions may be viewable by other users. You 
            are solely responsible for all User Submissions you contribute to the Services. You represent that all User Submissions submitted by you are in compliance with all applicable

            <br/>
            <p>In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions 
            (see below for more information). Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our <a href="<%= privacy_path %>">Privacy Policy</a> to the extent they relate 
            to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>By submitting User Submissions through the Services, you hereby do and shall grant Schemabook a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable 
            and transferable license to use, edit, modify, truncate, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit the User 
            Submissions to operate the Services, including to display User Submissions to other users within your organization. We may also aggregate or de-identify information from your 
            User Submissions in order to perform research and development and otherwise improve our products and services, but we will not publicly distribute such information in a way 
            that identifies you or your organization.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Certain features of the Services allow you to share information with others, including through your social networks or other Third Party Accounts. When Content is authorized 
            for sharing, we will clearly identify the Content you are authorized to redistribute and the ways you may redistribute it, usually by providing a “share” button on or near 
            the Content. If you share information from the Services with others through your Third Party Accounts, such as your social networks, you authorize Schemabook to share that 
            information with the applicable Third Party Account provider. Please review the policies of any Third Party Account providers you share information with or through for additional 
            information about how they may use your information. If you redistribute Content, you must be able to edit or delete any Content you redistribute, and you must edit or delete 
            it promptly upon our request.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Finally, you understand and agree that Schemabook, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes 
            to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses 
            include the rights to do so.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>You represent and warrant that you have all rights to grant the foregoing licenses to us without infringement or violation of any third party rights, including without 
            limitation, any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>

            <p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in 
            which you contribute it.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The Services may contain links or connections to websites or services of third parties that are not owned or controlled by Schemabook. When you access third-party websites 
            or use third-party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Schemabook is not responsible for such risks.</p>

            <p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, 
            conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation 
            you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any other third parties. You agree that Schemabook shall not be responsible or 
            liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site or Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that Schemabook is under no obligation to become involved. 
            In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Schemabook, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and 
            damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. 
            <strong>You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: </strong>“<strong>A general release 
            does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by 
            him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”</strong></p>

            <h2 id="will-schemabook-ever-change-the-services"><strong>Will Schemabook ever change the Services?</strong></h2>
            <br/>
            <p>We’re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose 
            limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely 
            affect you, but this isn’t always practical. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if 
            someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2 id="do-the-services-cost-anything"><strong>Do the Services cost anything?</strong></h2>
            <br/>
            <p><strong><em>(a) Paid Services</em></strong>. Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”). Please note that any payment terms 
            presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms. Please see our <a href="<%= pricing_path %>">Pricing page</a> for 
            additional information about fees. We reserve the right to change, or begin charging, fees for some or all Services in the future.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong><em>(b) Billing</em></strong>. We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on 
            the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment 
            Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you 
            agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, 
            and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment 
            Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong><em>(c) Payment Method</em></strong>. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the 
            financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree 
            to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong><em>(d) Recurring Billing</em></strong>. Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring 
            period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept 
            responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE 
            PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES 
            SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong><em>(e) Current Information Required</em></strong>. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE 
            ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND 
            YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, 
            SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE 
            FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES 
            AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong><em>(f) Change in Amount Authorized</em></strong>. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due 
            to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), for example, as a result of adding more users, we will provide an updated invoice and your Payment Method 
            will be automatically charged for the additional fees. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may 
            accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle (e.g., monthly).</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong><em>(g) Auto-Renewal for Paid Services</em></strong>. Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your account settings, any Paid Services you 
            have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current 
            non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account settings or, for mobile applications, cancel your subscription in the subscription 
            management section of the applicable App Store. If you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription 
            will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the 
            then-current subscription period. If you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis, you must cancel the applicable Paid Service through your account 
            settings or terminate your account before the end of the recurring TERM. Paid Services cannot be terminated before the end of the period for which you have already paid, 
            and except as expressly provided in these terms, Schemabook will not refund any fees that you have already paid.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong><em>(h) Reaffirmation of Authorization</em></strong>. Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your 
            Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment 
            directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</p>

            <br/>
            <h3 id="choice-of-law"><strong><em>Choice of Law</em></strong> </h3>

            <p>These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without 
            regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 id="arbitration-agreement"><strong><em>Arbitration Agreement</em></strong></h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Schemabook and limits the manner in 
            which you can seek relief from Schemabook. Both you and Schemabook acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the 
            subject matter of these Terms, Schemabook's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, 
            and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the 
            third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>(a)<em> Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</em>.</strong> The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, 
            question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to 
            either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Hamilton County, 
            Ohio. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in 
            effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected 
            from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of 
            competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>(b) <em>Costs of Arbitration</em>.</strong> The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Schemabook will pay all arbitration fees for claims 
            less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Schemabook will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your 
            claim is frivolous.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>(c) <em>Small Claims Court; Infringement</em>.</strong> Either you or Schemabook may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Hamilton 
            County, Ohio or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have 
            the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, 
            misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>(d) <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>.</strong> YOU AND SCHEMABOOK WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT 
            OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Schemabook are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, 
            more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Schemabook over 
            whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SCHEMABOOK WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a 
            judge.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>(e) <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>.</strong> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED 
            OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED 
            WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Schemabook 
            is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>(f) <em>Opt-out</em></strong>. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to 
            the following address: 10423 Rachel Anne Court, Cincinnati, OH 45241 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your 
            name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of 
            these Terms’ arbitration agreement.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>(g) <em>Exclusive Venue</em>.</strong> If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement 
            permits either you or Schemabook to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration 
            agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Schemabook agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the 
            state or federal courts located in, respectively, Hamilton County, Ohio, or the federal district in which that county falls.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>(h) <em>Severability</em>.</strong> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is 
            found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive 
            the termination of your relationship with Schemabook.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 id="miscellaneous"><strong><em>Miscellaneous</em></strong></h3>
            <br/>
            <p>You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in 
            connection with the Services, provided that the Schemabook may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The 
            failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these 
            Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise 
            remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Schemabook agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding 
            between you and Schemabook, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating 
            to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Schemabook, and you do not 
            have any authority of any kind to bind Schemabook in any respect whatsoever. Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the arbitration 
            agreement, you and Schemabook agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>
