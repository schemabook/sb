## Highlights
Defining your data
- Whether your data lives in a database table or is a published event payload, defining what's included can mean the difference between usable or not.

Creating a catalog
- Once teams define the data, publishing it in one place ultimately creates a catalog of your data helping you see the big picture.

Identifying stakeholders
- System boundaries and access layers can hide who the actual stakeholders of data are. We provide tools to not only identify but keep all stakeholders on the same page.

Fostering collaboration
- Requesting changes can be timely, hard to prioritize, and can have unforeseen consequences to other stakeholders. A central place to collaborate pays dividends.
